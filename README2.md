## Getting started with github 30

    This project was built using React and its hooks, also used axios to fetch api from github endpoint
    useEffect was a hook used as the lifecycle method for integrating the api. also CSS and its animations were used to style the application. also made responsive using media query. Also implemented an infinite scroll.

# usuage of application

Whenever the page loads it displays data from the api which shows descending order of most starred respository in the last 30 days. users can easily scroll inifinitely of different results

# imporovements

if this was not an assessment, I would have the users to be able to connect with the repository and its owner on github and also view a snippet of the repository
